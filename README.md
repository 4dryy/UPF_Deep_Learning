# 🧘‍♀️ Yoga Pose Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains the code, models, and evaluation tools developed for a deep learning project focused on **classifying yoga poses** from images using transfer learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The goal is to build an accurate and efficient image classification pipeline that distinguishes among **47 yoga pose classes** using modern architectures such as **ConvNeXt-Tiny** and **ResNet34**.
